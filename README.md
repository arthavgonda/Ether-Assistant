## Why EitherAssistant?

<div align="center">

### The Problem
> Most existing voice assistants are architected as cloud-dependent, application-restricted systems, resulting in high latency, limited control scope, reduced reliability in low-connectivity environments, and insufficient support for accessibility-focused use cases.

### The Solution
> EitherAssistant introduces an offline-first, OS-level voice automation architecture that enables deterministic control over applications and system resources, with accessibility and privacy as first-class design constraints.

<tr>
<td width="50%" valign = top >

#### Conventional Voice Assistants
- Cloud-centric STT and NLP pipelines  

- Mandatory continuous internet connectivity  

- Restricted to vendor-supported applications  

- Variable latency due to network round-trips  

- Audio and commands processed off-device  

- Designed primarily for general convenience  


</td>
<td width="55%" valign = top>

#### EitherAssistant
- Offline-first local speech inference  

- Fully functional without network access  

- OS- and browser-level control of any application 

- Predictable low-latency local execution
